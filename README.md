# Typography Blog

In this project, I made a blog webpage using HTML and CSS. 

With my limited HTML and CSS knowledge, I was able to work with Typography and various Selectors & Classes.

I improved my skills on Padding, Margin and Box Model properties. Also, I managed to fill the entire screen of hero section with viewport height unit.

Here are the screenshots of my project.
